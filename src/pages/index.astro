    <h1>Welcome to My Astro Blog</h1>
    <p>
      This blog is my exploration into the world of modern web development — built entirely with 
      <strong>Astro</strong>, a powerful static site generator designed for speed and simplicity. 
      Here, I’ll document what I learn about performance, accessibility, and web design, while 
      experimenting with how Astro renders content with <em>minimal JavaScript</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Expect tutorials, reflections, and occasional deep dives into how static site generators compare 
      with traditional front-end frameworks. My goal is to create something fast, lightweight, and easy to maintain — 
      a space that feels like both a project log and a learning journey.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether you’re a student, a developer, or someone just curious about new web tools, 
      I hope you find something useful or inspiring here. Feel free to start by exploring my latest posts!
